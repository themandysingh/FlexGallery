# FlexGallery
The Following was a practice for using flexbox and java script.

Clicking on any of the five panels expands the chosen panel and contracts the others with words dropping in from the top and the bottom of the chosen panel.

Clicking again on the chosen panel, returns the website to its initial
state with all 5 panels evenly distributed showing one word at the centre.
